# Introduction

This report constitutes the complete documentation of the system *ITU-MiniTwit* (henceforth just *MiniTwit*), a [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com) clone developed and maintained throughout the course *DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance* at the IT University of Copenhagen. MiniTwit is a rather simple client-server web application on which users should be able to post tweets and read each others' timelines. From session four until the last session, a *simulator* set up by the course managers to mimic user behavior has been interacting with our system.

The application is written entirely in *JavaScript* and containerized using *Docker*. Throughout the course, the application has been hosted on the cloud platform *DigitalOcean*.

The report contains three chapters. First, we present the *System Perspective*, in which the technical aspects of the system are thoroughly described. Secondly, we present the *Process Perspective*, in which the aspects relating to the development process are elaborated upon. Finally, we present the *Lesson Learned Perspective*, in which we reflect on our learnings during the course.
